        <h3>Atomic Elements</h3>
        <p>
            Computational element is an ideological cornerstone of the Kitchen platform.
            From the mathematical point of view, computational element is just a function
            with properly defined domain and range. From the philosophically point of view,
            it is a "potentiality" which turns into a "certainty" once "definiteness"
            is provided. We would designate computational elements as follows:

        <p>
            Computational element consists of inputs (golden) and outputs (purple).
            Both inputs and outputs could be defined or undefined. We distinguish defined
            items by designating them "being filled with water", as shown at the picture
            below. While at least one of the inputs of an element is undefined, element
            represents some potential computation which could be triggered by providing
            values into the remaining undefined inputs (<i>a</i>). Once all of the inputs
            are defined, element is activated and computation starts. When the computation
            is finished, defined values are provided for all of element's outputs (<i>b</i>).

        <p>
            Computation elements vary in size. Smallest elements correspond to machine
            instructions. They are built in the Kitchen and their execution is performed
            by means of underlying machine. Two examples are provided at the picture below.
            First example (<i>a</i>) is one of the smallest elements possible. It
            is simple summation of its two inputs. Second example (<i>b</i>) is an element
            which accepts array as its first input and index as its second input and
            returns array element at given index.

            Big computational elements outsize logical building blocks of underlying machine.
            Such elements require decomposition in order to be handled by the Kitchen system.

        <h3>Composed Elements</h3>
        <p>
            We would like to choose a decomposition of the computational element based on
            the philosophical point of view on the subject. According to this point of view
            element's essence is enclosed in the "potentiality" represented by it. For
            instances, consider a computational element which solves quadratic equation.
            Our first and most rough idea about it would be nearly as follows.
        </p>

             alt="Quadratic Equation Solver No Clue" class="kitchen-doc-img">
        <p>
            The equation itself is not something we are interested in, but the solution of
            the equation. In order to clarify what we mean by solution we need to take into
            account the setting in which equation arise. Let us additionally assume that this
            equation implied by following simple physics problem.
        </p>
        <blockquote>Boy throws a stone from atop of the tree and is interested in time when
            the stone would land on the ground.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Provided such a setting, we could deduce two additional assumption about solution
            of the derived equation. First assumption is that equation is not degenerate,
            because leading coefficient is proportional to the $g$ (strength of Earth's
            gravitational field). Therefore three coefficients define our equation. Second
            assumption is that equation would always have only real roots. This considerations
            excludes necessity of handling complex roots and branching on degeneracy of the
            equation. As a result we could specify our element's inputs and output as follows.
