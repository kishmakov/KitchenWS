        <h2>Primitive Types and Lists</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are number of primitive types in Kitchen Script.
            We use this types to initiate the process of type construction. Those are:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <li>Integer</li>
            <li>Double</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            With every type <i>T</i> we have an list of this type denoted as <i>[T]</i>.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Plain Objects</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Plain objects are constructed as JSON objects with <i>type</i> value equal <i>PO</i>.
            Object member names are all other keys of the describing JSON objects.
            Corresponding values are type description of the members.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For instance, object for geographic point could be represented as
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre>
{
  ...
  "GeographicPoint": {
    "type" : "PO",
    "longitude": "Double",
    "latitude": "Double"
  },
  ...
}</pre>
        <br>
        <p>
            We could use already defined types as well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre>
{
  ...
  "Country": {
    "type": "PO",
    "area": "Double",
    "population": "Integer",
    "cities": ["GeographicPoint"],
    "christiansDiscriminated": "Boolean"
  },
  ...
}</pre>
        <br>

        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Functions are represented as JSON objects with <i>type</i> value equal <i>F</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For instance, if we want to describe a type for function which returns a list
            of cities of given country which are within specified distance from specified
            point, it could be represented as
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre>
{
  ...
  "NeighbourhoodCities": {
    "type": "F",
    "result": ["GeographicPoint"],
    "0": "Country",
    "1": "Double",
    "2": "GeographicPoint"
  },
  ...
}</pre>
    </div>
