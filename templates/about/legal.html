                        the most convenient access to computational knowledge of the public domain
                        in order to flourish subsequent development, research and understanding.

                        We will do our best to preserve all accumulated public data.
                        That means that every single datum of information donated to our system or
                        generated within it will be available to everybody as long as our services are on.
                        And even more: we would update regularly decentralized version of backup for it be
                        stored as torrents.

                        Understanding that computational knowledge comes hand in hand with power, we
                        are deliberately apolitical. That means that we are not just focused on providing
                        uniform access to our services for all members of the international community,
                        but also locate our infrastructure in such a manner, that no particular group
