        <h3>Atomic Elements</h3>
        <p>
            Computational element is an ideological cornerstone of the Kitchen platform.
            From the mathematical point of view, computational element is just a function
            with properly defined domain and range. From the philosophically point of view,
            it is a "potentiality" which turns into a "certainty" once "definiteness"
            is provided. We would designate computational elements as follows:

        <p>
            Computational element consists of inputs (golden) and outputs (purple).
            Both inputs and outputs could be defined or undefined. We distinguish defined
            items by designating them "being filled with water", as shown at the picture
            below. While at least one of the inputs of an element is undefined, element
            represents some potential computation which could be triggered by providing
            values into the remaining undefined inputs (<i>a</i>). Once all of the inputs
            are defined, element is activated and computation starts. When the computation
            is finished, defined values are provided for all of element's outputs (<i>b</i>).

            Computation elements vary in size. Smallest elements correspond to machine
            instructions. They are built in the Kitchen and their execution is performed
            by means of underlying machine. Two examples are provided at the picture below.
            First example (<i>a</i>) is one of the smallest elements possible. It
            is simple summation of its two inputs. Second example (<i>b</i>) is an element
            which accepts array as its first input and index as its second input and
            returns array element at given index.

            Big computational elements outsize logical building blocks of underlying machine.
            Such elements require decomposition in order to be handled by the Kitchen system.
        </p>
        <h3>Composed Elements</h3>
        <p>
            We would like to choose a decomposition of the computational element based on
            the philosophical point of view on the subject. According to this point of view
            element's essence is enclosed in the "potentiality" represented by it. For
            instances, consider a computational element which solves quadratic equation.
            Our first and most rough idea about it would be nearly as follows.
        </p>
        <img src="{% static "images/computational_element_03.png" %}"
             alt="Quadratic Equation Solver No Clue" class="kitchen-doc-img">
        <p>
            The equation itself is not something we are interested in, but the solution of
            the equation. In order to clarify what we mean by solution we need to take into
            account the setting in which equation arise. Let us additionally assume that this
            equation implied by following simple physics problem.

        <blockquote>Boy throws a stone from atop of the tree and is interested in time when
            the stone would land on the ground.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Provided such a setting, we could deduce two additional assumptions about solution
            of derived equation. First assumption is that the equation is not degenerate,
            because leading coefficient is proportional to the $g$ (strength of Earth's
            gravitational field). Therefore three coefficients define our equation. Second
            assumption is that the equation would always have only real roots. This considerations
            excludes necessity of handling complex roots and branching on degeneracy of the
            equation. As a result we could specify our element's inputs and output as follows.

             alt="Quadratic Equation Solver Interface Specified" class="kitchen-doc-img">
        <p>
            Under indicated assumptions computational flow always travels the same way. We could
            construct an instance of quadratic equation solver from atomic elements as follows.

            Figuratively speaking, atomic elements act as a rails along which definiteness travels
            in the presented scheme. Possibility to construct such a scheme in advance is
            conditioned by the absence of branching in solver. Since the majority of the computations
            doesn't share this property we need to generalise this decomposition to the branching
            computations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us consider possibilities of first steps of the definiteness spread in the
            presented scheme. There are two of them, depicted below. Each step corresponds
            to the application of some other computational element.

            These two elements can be applied independently of values of output. In general
            situation is different: set of currently applicable elements is a subset of all
            potentially applicable elements for provided configuration of outputs. This subset
            depends on values of outputs. This is especially clear for conditional branching.
        </p>
        <p>
            Application of element changes the set of defined frontier outputs. This in turn
            brings us to a new sets of potentially and currently applicable elements. If we
            encapsulate all these observations we would end up with the notion of the <b>state</b>.
            Essentially state corresponds to the execution state of the program. More rigorously,
            state consists of
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>fixed set of defined frontier outputs $O$</li>
            <li>fixed set of potentially applicable computational elements $E$</li>
            <li>possible assignments of values of outputs; such assignments could be
                represented as a functions $O \to V$ where $V$ is the set of all possible
                values</li>
            <li>rule to determine subset of currently applicable computational elements
                by current outputs values: $c: \left(O \to V\right) \to 2^E$
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Globally computational element consists of finite number of states.
            These states constitute a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">
            finite state machine</a>. Transitions between states correspond to the applications
            of computational elements. How this correspondence arranged? Let us have a state
            characterized by $(O_1, E_1)$. Let $e \in E_1$ be one of potentially applicable
            elements. If we apply element to a state, then we would get a new set of frontier
            elements which we would denote as $O_1 \oplus e$. These new outputs should be
            identified with outputs of some other state $(O_2, E_2)$. All these identifications
            $O_1 \oplus e \equiv O_2$ settle transitional structure of finite-state machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            This description of computational element is recursive hence it needs some
            clarification. We favor applied resolution rather than formal one. Computational
            elements are in the same mutual relations as procedures in programming languages
            like C. They could depend on each other in arbitrary manner.
