            Kitchen is a platform for building computational algorithms. Computational
            algorithms vary in their size. While "small" algorithm could be treated
            as a whole both as an idea and as a computer representation, "big"
            algorithms are different. Standard approach to this problem is a
            modularization of "big" algorithms at the level of idea and in its
            computer representation.

            Cornerstone of the Kitchen modularization system is the notion of the <b>symbol</b>.
            Philosophically speaking symbol is everything which could be expressed, used
            in expressions and defined. Expressions are aimed to define one symbol via
            another symbols by means of algorithmic terms.

            Symbols are consumables of computation in the sense that once computation started,
            symbols are consequently get defined into numeric values. In a metaphoric way,
            you could think symbols like a pipes. These pipes are supposed to be filled with
            "definiteness" flow. When you define symbol, say A, via expression containing other
            symbols, say B and C, you connect the input of A-pipe to the output of B- and C-pipes.
