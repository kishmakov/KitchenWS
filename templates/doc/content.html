        <br>

        <p>
            Kitchen is a computational platform designed for convenient modularization
            of computational algorithms. Computational algorithm entity is a main object
            of interest within system.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kitchen platform is designed with the number of fundamental aspects being
            addressed. These are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>transparency of module interfaces for reusability</li>
            <li>integrated test-oriented assembly mechanism</li>
            <li>organic target functions support</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Kitchen Structure</h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Kitchen consists of
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>KitchenScript language</li>
            <li>documentation system</li>
            <li>assembly control system</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            KitchenScript is&nbsp;statically-typed programming language which could be&nbsp;compiled
            into a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;platforms, including JavaScript. When compiled to&nbsp;JavaScript,
            KitchenScript modules turned into a&nbsp;building blocks for computational algorithm assembly.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the assembly process components are compulsory verified for type correspondence
            and optionally pre-tested before joining together. Pre-testing is&nbsp;aimed to&nbsp;diminish
            probability of&nbsp;erroneous misusage of&nbsp;the component functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once assembly process is&nbsp;finished, resulted modularized algorithm would possess
            embedded documentation. This documentation structure is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reflection
            of&nbsp;modular structure of&nbsp;the algorithm.
