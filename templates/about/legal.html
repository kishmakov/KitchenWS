                        Goal of the Kitchen IDE project is to provide every person in the world with
                        the most convenient access to computational knowledge of public domain in order
                        to flourish subsequent development, research and understanding.

                    <h3>Irreversibility</h3>

                    <p class="lead">
                        We believe that free access to the knowledge is the public benefit.

                    <p>
                        Kitchen Team will do it best to preserve all the accumulated public data.
                        That means that every single datum of information donated to our system or
                        generated within it will be available to all people in the world as long as
                        our database backups would be available in the internet either in centralized
                        or decentralized form.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Independence</h3>

                    <p class="lead">
                        We believe that there is no chosen state, civilization or culture.

                    <p>
                        Understanding that computational knowledge could bring power, we intentionally
                        try to distribute our backups worldwide in such a manner, that no particular group
                        of people, state or states alliance could control access to knowledge base for
                        the rest of the world.
