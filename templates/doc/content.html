        <h2>What is Kitchen?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Kitchen is a computational platform designed for convenient modularization
            of computational algorithms and mathematical models. It designed with focus
            on <b>convenience of reusability of published result</b>.
        </p>

        <h2>Kitchen Structure</h2>

        <h3>Idea</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            First and most important concept of the Kitchen is the <b>computational element</b>.
            Computational element is a building block and the product of the system simultaneously.
            See <a ng-click="navigate('/doc/html/sections/0/')">Computational Element</a> section
            for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next concept of the Kitchen is the <b>target function</b>. Target function is the
            functional which maps computational element into number tuple. This mapping means
            evaluation of the element.
        </p>
        <p>
            We distinguish two types of target functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"predicates" &mdash; functionals with discrete range. Those are used for
            "pass/fail" setting.</li>
            <li>
                "scorings" &mdash; functionals which range is equipped with some partial order.
                Those are used for incremental improvement setting.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are number of aspects which were addressed during Kitchen design. These are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>formulation of work target via organically supported target functions</li>
            <li>test-oriented assembly mechanism embedded into platform tools</li>
            <li>organic support of multilingual documentation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Computational entity is a main object
            of interest within system.
            Kitchen platform is designed with the number of fundamental aspects being
            addressed. These are:
        </p>


        <h3>Implementation</h3>

        <p>
            Kitchen consists of
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>KitchenScript language</li>
            <li>documentation system</li>
            <li>assembly control system</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            KitchenScript is&nbsp;statically-typed programming language which could be&nbsp;compiled
            into a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;platforms, including JavaScript. When compiled to&nbsp;JavaScript,
            KitchenScript modules turned into a&nbsp;building blocks for computational algorithm assembly.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the assembly process components are compulsory verified for type correspondence
            and optionally pre-tested before joining together. Pre-testing is&nbsp;aimed to&nbsp;diminish
            probability of&nbsp;erroneous misusage of&nbsp;the component functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once assembly process is&nbsp;finished, resulted modularized algorithm would possess
            embedded documentation. This documentation structure is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reflection
            of&nbsp;modular structure of&nbsp;the algorithm.
